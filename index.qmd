# About

## Who are we

We are the R user groups located in South Africa.

## What is R

R is a programming language for statistical computing, data analysis and visualisation of data. R is free and open source. Learn more at <http://www.r-project.org/>.

## Our goals

Our purpose is to bring R users together to help each other with common problems, exchange knowledge and share experiences.

Secondly, this group intends to spread the use of R in South Africa and show others (also non-R users) the benefits of using R.

## R-Ladies

As a diversity initiative, R-Ladies' mission is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies' primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide. There are 155 local groups spread across 46 countries, and two of those groups are in South Africa, Cape Town and Johannesburg.
